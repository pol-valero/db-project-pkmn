Once one has been blocked, the Pokémon's own Fire moves inflict 1.5× damage until it leaves battle."
"19","shield dust","This Pokémon is immune to the extra effects of moves used against it.

An extra effect is a move's chance, listed as an ""effect chance"", to inflict a status ailment, cause a stat change, or make the target flinch in addition to the move's main effect.  For example, thunder shock's paralysis is an extra effect, but thunder wave's is not, nor are knock off's item removal and air cutter's increased critical hit rate.","Protects against incoming moves' extra effects."
"20","own tempo","This Pokémon cannot be confused.

If a Pokémon is confused and acquires this ability, its confusion will immediately be healed.","Prevents confusion."

Moves that inflict fixed damage, such as night shade or seismic toss, are considered super effective if their types are.  Damage not directly dealt by moves, such as damage from weather, a status ailment, or spikes, is not prevented.

This ability cannot be copied with role play or traded away with skill swap, but it can be copied with trace, disabled with gastro acid, or changed with worry seed.  This Pokémon can still use Role Play itself to lose this ability, but not Skill Swap.

If this Pokémon has a substitute, this ability will block moves as usual and any moves not blocked will react to the Substitute as usual.","Protects against damaging moves that are not super effective."

"31","lightning rod","All other Pokémon's single-target electric-type moves are redirected to this Pokémon if it is an eligible target.  Other Pokémon's Electric moves raise this Pokémon's Special Attack one stage, negating any other effect on it, and cannot miss it.

If the move's intended target also has this ability, the move is not redirected.  When multiple Pokémon with this ability are possible targets for redirection, the move is redirected to the one with the highest Speed stat, or, in the case of a tie, to a random tied Pokémon.  follow me takes precedence over this ability.

If the Pokémon is a ground-type and thus immune to Electric moves, its immunity prevents the Special Attack boost.","Redirects single-target electric moves to this Pokémon where possible.  Absorbs Electric moves, raising Special Attack one stage."

If multiple Pokémon with this ability, drizzle, drought, or snow warning are sent out at the same time, the abilities will activate in order of Speed, respecting trick room.

Overworld: If the lead Pokémon has this ability, the wild encounter rate is halved in a sandstorm.","Summons a sandstorm that lasts indefinitely upon entering battle."
"46","pressure","Moves targetting this Pokémon use one extra PP.

This ability stacks if multiple targets have it.  This ability still affects moves that fail or miss.

If this ability raises a move's PP cost above its remaining PP, it will use all remaining PP.

When this Pokémon enters battle, all participating trainers are notified that it has this ability.

Overworld: If the lead Pokémon has this ability, higher-levelled Pokémon have their encounter rate increased.","Increases the PP cost of moves targetting the Pokémon by one."
"47","thick fat","This Pokémon takes half as much damage from fire- and ice-type moves.","Halves damage from fire and ice moves."

"50","run away","This Pokémon is always successful fleeing from wild battles, even if trapped by a move or ability.","Ensures success fleeing from wild battles."
"51","keen eye","This Pokémon cannot have its accuracy lowered.

This ability does not prevent any accuracy losses other than stat modifiers, such as the accuracy cut from fog; nor does it prevent other Pokémon's evasion from making this Pokémon's moves less accurate.  This Pokémon can still be passed negative accuracy modifiers through heart swap.

Overworld: If the first Pokémon in the party has this ability, any random encounter with a Pokémon five or more levels lower than it has a 50% chance of being skipped.","Prevents accuracy from being lowered."

"53","pickup","At the end of each turn, if another Pokémon consumed or Flung a held item that turn, this Pokémon picks up the item if it is not already holding one.  After each battle, this Pokémon has a 10% chance of picking up an item if it is not already holding one.

"54","truant","Every second turn on which this Pokémon should attempt to use a move, it will instead do nothing (""loaf around"").

Loafing around interrupts moves that take multiple turns the same way paralysis, flinching, etc do.  Most such moves, for example bide or rollout, are simply cut off upon loafing around.  Attacks with a recharge turn, such as hyper beam, do not have to recharge; attacks with a preparation turn, such as fly, do not end up being used.  Moves that are forced over multiple turns and keep going through failure, such as outrage, uproar, or any move forced by encore, keep going as usual.

If this Pokémon is confused, its confusion is not checked when loafing around; the Pokémon cannot hurt itself, and its confusion does not end or come closer to ending.

If this Pokémon attempts to move but fails, e.g. because of paralysis or gravity, it still counts as having moved and will loaf around the next turn.  If it does not attempt to move, e.g. because it is asleep or frozen, whatever it would have done will be postponed until its next attempt; that is, it will either loaf around or move as usual, depending on what it last did.

This ability cannot be changed with worry seed, but it can be disabled with gastro acid, changed with role play, or traded away with skill swap.","Skips every second turn."
"55","hustle","This Pokémon's physical moves do 1.5× as much regular damage, but have 0.8× their usual accuracy.

Overworld: If the lead Pokémon has this ability, higher-levelled Pokémon have their encounter rate increased.","Strengthens physical moves to inflict 1.5× damage, but decreases their accuracy to 0.8×."
"56","cute charm","Whenever a move makes contact with this Pokémon, the move's user has a 30% chance of being infatuated.

Overworld: If the first Pokémon in the party has this ability, any wild Pokémon whose species can be either gender has a 2/3 chance of being set to the opposite gender, and a 1/3 chance of having a random gender as usual.","Has a 30% chance of infatuating attacking Pokémon on contact."
"57","plus","This Pokémon has 1.5× its Special Attack if any friendly Pokémon has plus or minus.

"59","forecast","During rain, strong sunlight, or hail, this Pokémon's type changes to water, fire, or ice, respectively, and its form changes to match.

This ability has no effect for any Pokémon other than castform.

If the weather ends or becomes anything that does not trigger this ability, or a Pokémon with air lock or cloud nine enters battle, this Pokémon's type and form revert to their default.  If this ability is lost or disabled, this Pokémon cannot change its current type and form until it regains its ability.","Changes castform's type and form to match the weather."
"60","sticky hold","This Pokémon's hold item cannot be removed by other Pokémon.

Overworld: If the lead Pokémon has this ability, the encounter rate while fishing is increased.","Prevents a held item from being removed by other Pokémon."
"61","shed skin","After each turn, this Pokémon has a 33% of being cured of any major status ailment.","Has a 33% chance of curing any major status ailment after each turn."
"62","guts","Whenever this Pokémon is asleep, burned, paralyzed, or poisoned, it has 1.5× its Attack.  This Pokémon is not affected by the usual Attack cut from a burn.

This bonus does not count as a stat modifier.","Increases Attack to 1.5× with a major status ailment."
"63","marvel scale","Whenever this Pokémon has a major status ailment, it has 1.5× its Defense.

This bonus does not count as a stat modifier.","Increases Defense to 1.5× with a major status ailment."

dream eater is unaffected.","Damages opponents using leeching moves for as much as they would heal."

struggle's recoil is unaffected.  This ability does not prevent crash damage from missing with jump kick or high jump kick.","Protects against recoil damage."
"70","drought","The weather changes to strong sunlight when this Pokémon enters battle and does not end unless cancelled by another weather condition.

If multiple Pokémon with this ability, drizzle, sand stream, or snow warning are sent out at the same time, the abilities will activate in order of Speed, respecting trick room.  Each ability's weather will cancel the previous weather, and only the weather summoned by the slowest of the Pokémon will stay.","Summons strong sunlight that lasts indefinitely upon entering battle."
"71","arena trap","While this Pokémon is in battle, opposing Pokémon cannot flee or switch out.  flying-type Pokémon and Pokémon in the air, e.g. due to levitate or magnet rise, are unaffected.

Pokémon with run away can still flee.  Pokémon can still switch out with the use of a move or item.

Overworld: If the lead Pokémon has this ability, the wild encounter rate is doubled.","Prevents opponents from fleeing or switching out.  Eluded by flying-types and Pokémon in the air."

This ability functions identically to cloud nine.","Negates all effects of weather, but does not prevent the weather itself."
"77","tangled feet","When this Pokémon is confused, it has twice its evasion.","Doubles evasion when confused."
"78","motor drive","Whenever an electric-type move hits this Pokémon, its Speed rises one stage, negating any other effect on it.

This ability will not take effect if this Pokémon is immune to Electric moves.  Electric moves will ignore this Pokémon's substitute.

This effect includes non-damaging moves, i.e. thunder wave.","Absorbs electric moves, raising Speed one stage."

For example, this Pokémon takes no damage from from weather, recoil, status ailments, or spikes, but it still suffers from the Attack cut when burned, and a life orb will still power up this Pokémon's moves without damaging it.  Anything that directly depends on such damage will also not happen; for example, leech seed will neither hurt this Pokémon nor heal the opponent, and Pokémon with a jaboca berry or rowap berry will not consume the berry when hit by this Pokémon.

The following are unaffected: struggle, pain split (whether used by or against this Pokémon), belly drum, substitute, curse, moves that knock the user out, and damage from confusion.

This Pokémon will neither lose nor regain HP if it drains HP from a Pokémon with liquid ooze.

If this Pokémon is badly poisoned, the poison counter is still increased each turn; if the Pokémon loses this ability, it will begin taking as much damage as it would be if it had been taking increasing damage each turn.","Protects against damage not directly caused by a move."
"99","no guard","Moves used by or against this Pokémon never miss.

One-hit KO moves are unaffected.  Moves affected by this ability can hit Pokémon during the preparation turn of moves like dig or fly.

Overworld: If the lead Pokémon has this ability, the wild encounter rate is doubled.","Ensures all moves used by and against the Pokémon hit."
"100","stall","This Pokémon moves last within its priority bracket.

Multiple Pokémon with this ability move in order of Speed amongst themselves.

The full incense and lagging tail take precedence over this ability; that is, Pokémon with these items move after Pokémon with this ability.  Pokémon with both this ability and one of these items are delayed as much as if they had only the item.

This ability works as usual during trick room: Pokémon with this ability will move in reverse order of Speed after Pokémon without it.","Makes the Pokémon move last within its move's priority bracket."
"101","technician","This Pokémon's moves have 1.5× their power if their base power is 60 or less.

This includes moves of variable power, such as hidden power and magnitude, when their power is 60 or less.  helping hand's power boost is taken into account for any move, as is defense curl's power boost for rollout.","Strengthens moves of 60 base power or less to 1.5× their power."
"102","leaf guard","This Pokémon cannot be given a major status ailment during strong sunlight.

This ability does not heal prior status ailments.  rest will fail altogether with this ability in effect.  yawn will immediately fail if used on this Pokémon during strong sunlight, and an already-used Yawn will fail if the weather turns to strong sunlight in the meantime.","Protects against major status ailments during strong sunlight."
"103","klutz","In battle, this Pokémon cannot use its held item, nor will the item have any passive effect on the battle, positive or negative.  This Pokémon also cannot use fling.

The Speed cut from the iron ball and the effort items (the macho brace, power weight, power bracer, power belt, power lens, power band, and power anklet) is unaffected.  Items that do not directly affect the battle, such as the exp share, the amulet coin, or the soothe bell, work as usual.  All held items work as usual out of battle.

Other moves that use the held item, such as natural gift and switcheroo, work as usual.","Prevents the Pokémon from using its held item in battle."
"104","mold breaker","This Pokémon's moves completely ignore abilities that could hinder or prevent their effect on the target.

For example, this Pokémon's moves ignore abilities that would fully negate them, such as water absorb; abilities that would prevent any of their effects, such as clear body, shell armor, or sticky hold; and abilities that grant any general protective benefit, such as simple, snow cloak, or thick fat.  If an ability could either hinder or help this Pokémon's moves, e.g. dry skin or unaware, the ability is ignored either way.

Abilities that do not fit this description, even if they could hinder moves in some other way, are not affected.  For example, cursed body only affects potential future uses of the move, while liquid ooze and shadow tag can only hinder a move's effect on the user.  This ablity cannot ignore type or form changes granted by abilities, for example color change or forecast; nor effects that were caused by abilities but are no longer tied to an ability, such as the rain from drizzle.  This ability cannot ignore multitype at all.

An ability ignored by this ability is only nullified while the move is being used.  For example, this Pokémon's moves can paralyze a Pokémon with limber, but Limber will activate and heal the paralysis immediately thereafter, and this Pokémon's spikes are not affected by this ability after they have been placed.

When this Pokémon enters battle, all participating trainers are notified that it has this ability.

The move itself is not revealed; only that there is such a move.  Moves that inflict typeless damage, such as future sight, and moves of variable type, such as hidden power, count as their listed types.  counter, metal burst, mirror coat, and one-hit KO moves to which this Pokémon is immune do not trigger this ability.","Notifies all trainers upon entering battle if an opponent has a super-effective move, self destruct, explosion, or a one-hit KO move."
"108","forewarn","When this Pokémon enters battle, it reveals the move with the highest base power known by any opposing Pokémon to all participating trainers.

This ability also takes effect when acquired during battle.  If this Pokémon loses its ability before the five turns are up, its Attack and Speed return to normal; if it then regains this ability without leaving battle, its Attack and Speed are halved again, but the counter keeps counting from where it was.","Halves Attack and Speed for five turns upon entering battle."
"113","scrappy","This Pokémon ignores ghost-type Pokémon's immunity to normal- and fighting-type moves.

Ghost Pokémon's other types affect damage as usual.","Lets the Pokémon's normal and fighting moves hit ghost Pokémon."
"114","storm drain","All other Pokémon's single-target water-type moves are redirected to this Pokémon, if it is an eligible target.  Other Pokémon's Water moves raise this Pokémon's Special Attack one stage, negating any other effect on it, and cannot miss it.

If the move's intended target also has this ability, the move is not redirected.  When multiple Pokémon with this ability are possible targets for redirection, the move is redirected to the one with the highest Speed stat, or, in the case of a tie, to a random tied Pokémon.  follow me takes precedence over this ability.","Redirects single-target water moves to this Pokémon where possible.

This ability functions identically to filter.","Decreases damage taken from super-effective moves by 1/4."
"117","snow warning","The weather changes to hail when this Pokémon enters battle and does not end unless cancelled by another weather condition.

If multiple Pokémon with this ability, drizzle, drought, or sand stream are sent out at the same time, the abilities will activate in order of Speed, respecting trick room.  Each ability's weather will cancel the previous weather, and only the weather summoned by the slowest of the Pokémon will stay.","Summons hail that lasts indefinitely upon entering battle."
"118","honey gather","This Pokémon has a chance of picking up honey after each battle.  This chance starts at 5% and rises another 5% after every tenth level: 5% from level 1–10, 10% from 11–20, and so on, up to 50% from 91–100.

This ability is checked after the battle ends, at which point any temporary ability changes have worn off.","The Pokémon may pick up honey after battle."
"119","frisk","When this Pokémon enters battle, it reveals an opposing Pokémon's held item to all participating trainers.

This Pokémon's held item, whether or not it is a Plate, cannot be taken by covet or thief, nor removed by knock off, nor traded by switcheroo or trick.  Covet, Thief, and Knock Off still inflict damage against this Pokémon.  Unlike with sticky hold, this Pokémon cannot use fling, Switcheroo, or Trick to lose its item itself, nor gain an item through Switcheroo or Trick if it does not have one.

This ability has no effect for any Pokémon other than arceus.  This ability cannot be traded with skill swap, nor copied with role play or trace, nor disabled with gastro acid, nor changed with worry seed.  This Pokémon cannot use Skill Swap or Role Play to lose its ability itself.  mold breaker cannot ignore this ability.

If a Pokémon Transforms into an Arceus with this ability, it will Transform into Arceus's default, normal-type form.

"122","flower gift","Friendly Pokémon have 1.5× their Attack and Special Defense during strong sunlight if any friendly Pokémon has this ability.

Unlike forecast, multitype, and zen mode, this ability is not tied to its Pokémon's form change; cherrim will switch between its forms even if it loses this ability.  As such, this ability also works if obtained by a Pokémon other than Cherrim.","Increases friendly Pokémon's Attack and Special Defense to 1.5× during strong sunlight."

An effect chance is a move's chance to inflict a status ailment, cause a stat change, or make the target flinch in addition to the move's main effect.
